title: 2 - The Rise of Data

---

Data... a collection of symbols representing the quality or quantity of a physical phenomenon.

---

Humans have likely been using data for as long as we've been counting on our fingers.

---

We have evidence of humans carving notches into wood, bone, and stone to count days, lunar cycles, and animals for at least the past forty-thousand years.

---

A few millennia ago, the Sumerians, Egyptians, and Chinese were recording written counts of items, animals, people, and astronomical observations.

---

They recorded these data using clay tablets, papyrus, and parchment, using early writing systems like cuneiform, hieroglyphics, and logographs.

---

A few centuries ago, data were collected by governments for census and taxation, or by businesses for accounting, inventory, and transactions.

---

Data at this point in history were recorded largely using quill pens in paper ledgers.

---

In the 1800s, mechanical computers radically sped up data processing and ushered in a new area of data analysis.

---

For example, the 1880 US census took over 7 years to process and analyze without a computer.

---

However, the 1890 US census, took only 18 months thanks to Herman Hollerith's punch-card-based ""Tabulating Machine"".

---

In the 1900s, electrical computers dramatically increased both data storage and processing capabilities.

---

By the mid-1900s, digital computers allowed us to store and analyze data as bits of information encoded as ones and zeros.

---

In the 1980s, the emergence of relational databases allowed us to efficiently store and process transactional data.

---

We also saw the emergence of programming languages like structured query language which allow us to rapidly query and analyze data.

---

In the 1990s, data warehouses, data marts, and data cubes were used to store and analyze ever-larger growing sets of data.

---

We also saw the emergence of data mining to allow us to discover patterns of interest in large data sets.

---

In the 2000s, big-data platforms emerged to handle very large data sets by spreading data and processing across several computers in a cluster.

---

We also saw the rise of machine learning - training computer algorithms on large sets of data to classify new data and make predictions.

---

In the 2010s, cloud-scale distributed computing platforms emerged to handle storing and processing of data across thousands of computers in a data center.

---

This decade also ushered in the era of deep learning - training deep neural networks on very large data sets to classify and predict much more complex patterns of data.

---

As we move into 2020s, the explosion of data from the internet of things is leading to a need for new methods to store and process data.

---

In addition, the demand for modern data analysis has made data science one of the most in-demand professions of the 21st century.

---

In the next decade and beyond, the field of data science will continue to grow and will likely evolve into data-driven artificial intelligence.

A new era of data that will almost certainly change our world in more ways than we could possibly imagine.","---

The purpose of this course is to learn about data as a foundation for data science.

It might seem obvious, but half of data science is data, so as you can imagine, it's really important to have a thorough understanding of data to be successful with data science. 

This course was designed to provide you with that foundational knowledge.

---

As an overview of this course:

First, we'll learn about data. 

We'll learn what it is, and why it's important for data science.

Next we'll learn about the various types of data we encounter in data science, including categorical and numerical data.

Then we'll learn about data types, and how we represent and store various kinds of data in a computer.

Next, we'll learn about data structures, and how providing structure to data gives it additional context and meaning.

Then, we'll learn about tabular data, tables of data organized into rows and columns that allow us to perform queries.

Finally, we'll learn about the data life cycle.

We'll learn about the journey of data as we move from raw data to actionable insight.

---

There are no prerequisites for this course.

We will assume you are new to data, data science, and computer programming throughout this entire course.

In addition, you won't need to install any software on your computer to complete this course.

We'll keep everything in this course as simple and easy to understand as possible.

Hello again. 

And welcome back to this introductory course on data for data science.

I'm Matthew Renze - data science consultant, author, and public speaker.

In this module, we'll learn about data.

We'll learn what it is, and why it's important for data science.

---

What is data?

... or technically, the more grammatically correct question is, ...

---

... ""what *are* data?""

More importantly, what is the purpose of data?

And why is it important or useful to us in data science?

---

To answer these questions, we're going to learn about data and how it is used in data science.

First, we'll learn about data... what it is, and why it's important.

Next, we'll learn about information and how we can extract information from data.

Then, we'll learn about knowledge and how we can create knowledge from information.

Next, we'll learn about the purpose of data and how it leads to intelligent decision making.

Finally, we'll learn about the process of transforming raw data into actionable insight.","---

title: 2 - Data

---

When we think of data we might imagine:

 - a bunch of ones-and-zeros sitting inside of a computer, 

 - the stats from our favorite sports team, 

 - or the medical records at our local hospital.

But what exactly are data?

---

Data are a collection of symbols that describe observations of the world around us.

They record facts about the natural world that we live in.

These include descriptions of the qualities of things in our world, for example, colors, shapes, and textures.

In addition, they include measurements of quantities of things in our world, for example: size, weight, and velocity.

---

Data are represented using symbols.

This includes representing qualities of things using words, for example, the color of an apple is red.

In addition, this includes representing quantities of things using numbers, for example, the apple has a mass of 100 grams.

---

Imagine we're feeling sick and we go to see our doctor.

Our doctor takes a measurement of our body temperature using a thermometer.

The thermometer reads 39 degrees Celsius

which is 102 degrees Fahrenheit -- for those of us who've yet to switch to the metric system

Based on this temperature, it's clear that we're running a fever.

---

This temperature value of 39 degrees Celsius is what we refer to as a ""datum"" (i.e. a single piece of data).

The word ""data"" is actually the plural form of the word ""datum"".

So when we have more than one ""datum"", we have ""data"".

However, most people now use the term ""data"" in both the singular and plural form, interchangeably.

The term ""datum"" is now rarely, if ever, used.

Data can be used to create information.

However, in order to create information, we first need to organize, analyze, and interpret the data.","---

module: 2 - Data
title: 3 - Information

---

Information is everywhere.

We have information on the menus at our restaurants, in the books in our libraries, and on street signs while we're driving.

But what exactly is information in the context of data science?

---

Information is something that reduces uncertainty about our world.

It is the answer to questions like who, what, where, how many, or how much.

Essentially, information provides clarity about the world we live in.

---

Information is created from data.

We create information by organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data.

Organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data gives it context and meaning.

This additional context and meaning is essentially what distinguishes data from information.

---

For example, imagine that our doctor has a recorded a history of our normal body temperature over the past few years.

They analyze the historical data and computes that our average (or normal) body temperature is 37°C.

This average temperature of 37°C is what we call information.

---

Information is more meaningful than the individual data points that were used to create it.

This makes information quite useful on it's own.

However, information can also be used to create something more powerful -- it can be used to create knowledge.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 2 - Data
title: 4 - Knowledge

---

Sir Francis Bacon famously said that ""knowledge is power"";

But what makes knowledge so powerful?

And what exactly is knowledge in the first place?

---

Knowledge is a theoretical or practical understanding of the natural world around us.

It explains the observations that we see and why things behave the way they do.

In addition, it allows us to predict the behavior of phenomena in our world.

Both of which, are quite beneficial to our survival and our ability to thrive in the world.

---

Knowledge is created from information.

It is essentially a collection of information that has been organized to provide a consistent and cohesive understanding of a specific topic.

From a more pragmatic standpoint, knowledge is used to solve problems within a specific domain.

Knowledge allows us to make decisions so that we can take an action that leads us to a goal of some kind.

---

For example, imagine that our doctor knows that when a person's body temperature rises to 39°C, that they are likely fighting an infection.

This relationship between an increase in body temperature and the presence of an infection is what we refer to as knowledge.

In the case of our example, our doctor would use this knowledge to decide that we are most likely fighting an infection. 

As a result of this knowledge, they would likely take the action of recommending that we get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, and potentially get further testing if necessary.

---

Knowledge alone isn't enough to solve problems.

In order to solve real-world problems, we need to use knowledge in combination with new information.

It's this combination of existing knowledge and new information that leads to a solution to a problem.

For example, our doctor used a combination of their existing medical knowledge and new information about our current body temperature to decide that we were likely fighting an infection and recommend a course of treatment.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 2 - Data
title: 5 - Purpose

---

What is the purpose of collecting data, creating information, and acquiring knowledge?

Essentially, what makes data so important in data science?

---

Data, on it's own, is useless. 

However, it can be a stepping stone to achieve a goal or an objective of some kind.

In order to achieve our goal we need to transform data into something that is actionable.

We need to transform our data into actionable insight.

---

We do this through the following process:

First, we collect data by observing the world and recording our observations.

Next, we organize, analyze, and interpret our data to create information.

Then, we combine this information with other information to create knowledge.

Next, we use this knowledge and new information to make an informed decision about which action to take.

Then, we can take action with the confidence that we have increased the likelihood of achieving our goal.

---

In data science, we refer to this process as ""transforming data into actionable insight"".

In the world of business, this is often referred to as ""data-driven decision making"".

In our daily lives, we simply refer to this process as ""intelligence"" -- the use of knowledge and new information to make rational decisions about actions that will maximize our chances of achieving a goal.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 2 - Data
title: 6 - Process

---

Let's take a look at a simple example of intelligent data-driven decision making in action.

---

Imagine that we're an investor.

We're considering making an investment in apples -- the edible kind -- not the iPod kind.

Our goal, obviously, is to make a profit.

However, we want to make our investment using a data-driven decision-making process.

---

First, we learn that the price of apples has been holding steady for the past year at $2 per kilogram (which is about $2 for 6 apples).

We create data when we observe and record the current price of apples at $2 per kilogram.

---

Next we learn that the price of apples has risen this month from $2 per kilogram to $3 per kilogram.

This price increase was caused by a rapid, unexpected increase in consumer demand.

We create information when we analyze the historical price data and discover the $1 increase in the price of apples this month.

---

Then, from many years of observation, we've learned that when the price of apples goes up by $1 per kilogram, then price of apple cider will likely rise by $1.50 per liter in the following month.

We acquired knowledge when we learned about the relationship between an increase in the price of apples and an increase in the price of apple cider.

---

Next, based on our existing knowledge and the new information about the price increase, we make a decision.

We decide it would be smart to invest in apple cider now, before the price of apple cider rises by an extra $1.50 per liter next month.

---

Then, based on our decision, we take action.

We invest in apple cider on the commodities market at it's current (discounted) price, in anticipation of an increase in price, and thus an increase in the value of our investment.

---

Finally, if everything worked out in our favor, and the price of apple cider rises as predicted, we will have achieved our goal of capturing a profit on our investment.

However, achieving our goal is entirely dependent upon having correct data, information, knowledge, decisions, actions -- and the apple-cider market working in our favor! : )

While this has been an overly simplified example of how data-driven decision making works, hopefully it helped to demonstrate to you how we use data to achieve a goal with data science.","---

Hello, and welcome back to this introductory course on data for data science.

I'm Matthew Renze, data science consultant, author, and public speaker.

In this module, we'll learn about the various types of data that we will encounter in data science.

---

What types of data exist in data science?

How do we conceptually divide data into groups based on what they represent?

And what are the limitations of each of these types of data?

---

To answer these questions, we're going to learn about the various types of data that exist in data science and their various capabilities and limitations.

First, we'll learn about the two most common types of data: categorical and numerical data.

Next, we'll learn about nominal data, named categories without a natural rank order.

Then we'll learn about ordinal data, named categories that do have a natural rank order.

Next, we'll learn about interval data, numerical measures with an arbitrary zero point.

Finally, we'll learn about ratio data, numerical measures with a natural zero point.","---

In data science, there are two main types of data: categorical data and numerical data.

These are the two most common types of data you will encounter in data science and the most common way of classifying or grouping the various types of data.

You'll encounter them quite frequently in data science, so it's important that you clearly understand the distinction between the two.

So, let's spend some time learning about each of them in more detail.

Categorical data represent named qualities of an observed phenomenon.

This includes using words to describe the names or properties of objects, like their color, shape, and texture.

For example, the color of an apple is red. 

The word ""red"" describes the quality of the color of the apple.

In data science, we refer to categorical data as ""qualitative data"" since they describe the quality of the thing they represent.

However, most beginners more intuitively understand the term ""categorical"" rather than ""qualitative"", so we'll continue referring to this type of data as ""categorical"" data.

---

Numerical data represents measured quantities of an observed phenomenon.

This includes using numbers to describe the measurement of objects like their size, weight, and velocity.

For example, the price of 6 apples is $2.00.

""Six"" represents the quantity of apples, and ""$2.00"" represents the price of the apples.

In data science, we refer to numerical data as ""quantitative data"" since they describe the quantity of the thing they represent.

However, because most beginners often confuse the terms ""qualitative"" and ""quantitative"" we're going to continue referring to this type of data as ""numerical"" data.

---

Categorical and numerical data can be further divided into four subtypes.

---

Categorical data can be divided into nominal and ordinal data.

And numerical data can be divided into interval and ratio data.

Let's take a look at each of these four subtypes of data, next.","---

title: 3 - Nominal Data

---

The first type of categorical data that we encounter in data science are nominal data.

---

Nominal data are a type of categorical data.

That is, they are used to represent named qualities.

However, nominal data have no natural rank order to them (i.e. they differ by their name only).

---

For example, the colors red, green, and yellow all describe the color of apples.

However, no one color is greater than or less than another color.

These three colors have no natural rank order to them.

They differ by their name alone.

---

Other examples of nominal data include:

your name, 

your credit card number, 

and the name of the city where you were born.

The key distinction is that nominal values have no natural order to them.

However, they can still be sorted alphabetically.

---

There are a limited number of mathematical operations that we can perform on nominal data.

We can test two nominal values for equality (i.e. determine if they are the same named category).

In addition, we can determine their mode (i.e. the most frequently occurring category in a set of nominal values).

Despite these limitations, nominal data are still quite useful in data science.","---

title: 4 - Ordinal Data

---

The second type of categorical data that we encounter in data science are ordinal data.

---

Ordinal data are a type of categorical data.

That is, they describe named qualities of things.

However, ordinal data do have a natural rank order to them.

So they can be sorted in order by their rank.

---

For example, we could group apples into small, medium, and large sizes. 

Medium apples are larger than small apples, and large apples are larger than medium apples, so they do have a natural rank order.

---

Other examples of ordinal data include:  

bronze, silver, and gold medals in the Olympics, 

assigning letter grades for student test scores, 

and low, medium, and high speeds on a portable fan.

The key distinction is that ordinal values do have a natural order to them -- so we can sort them in a natural way.

---

We can perform a few more mathematical operations on ordinal data than on nominal data.

In addition to testing for both equality and determining the mode.

We can also test two ordinal values for their order (by determining if one value is ranked greater than or less than another).

In addition, we can determine the median (i.e. the middle most value in a list of sorted values).

Ordinal data are a bit more powerful than nominal data, in terms of mathematical operations, but still not as powerful as interval and ratio data.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 3 - Types of Data
title: 5 - Interval Data

---

The first type of numerical data that we encounter in data science are interval data.

---

Interval data are a type of numerical data.

That is, they represent measured quantities of things.

Interval data allow for a degree of difference between two values 

(i.e. we can add or subtract the values in meaningful ways).

However, interval scales have an arbitrary zero point on their scale 

(i.e. the place were zero appears on the scale was chosen for convenience -- not because it represents a true absence of the thing being measured.

So there is no concept of a ratio between two numbers or the ability to multiply or divide two numbers in any meaningful way.

---

For example, imagine a thermometer measuring outdoor temperature.

The zero point on a Celsius thermometer represents the temperature where water freezes.

This is simply for convenience -- zero on this scale does not represent absolute zero heat, like it does on the Kelvin scale.

The difference between 20°C and 30°C (which is a 10° change) is the same difference in temperature as a change from 40° to 50° (also a 10° change).

So we can perform addition and subtraction with this interval scale.

---

However, it doesn't make sense to say that 20°C is half as hot as 40°C -- or that 40°C is twice as hot as 20°C.

This is because 0°C isn't the absence of all heat -- but rather was an arbitrarily chosen point on the scale where water freezes.

---

So it simply doesn't make sense to discuss ratios, multiplication, or division with the Celsius temperature scale... or other interval scales.

---

Other examples of interval data include: 

dates on a calendar, 

IQ scores, 

and longitudes on a map.

The key distinction is that the zero point on an interval scale is arbitrarily chosen; it doesn't represent a natural minimum quantity of the thing being measured.

---

We can perform a few more mathematical operations on interval data than we can on nominal and ordinal data.

In addition to testing for equality, sorting by order, and determining both the mode and the median.

We can also add or subtract interval data.

In addition, we can also determine the arithmetic mean (i.e. average value in a set of interval values).

Interval data are a bit more powerful than nominal and ordinal data in terms of mathematical operations, but still not as powerful as ratio data.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science

title: 6 - Ratio Data

---

The second type of numerical data that we encounter in data science are ratio data.

---

Ratio data are a type of numerical data.

That is, they represent measured quantities of things.

Ratio data allow for a degree of difference between two values, just like interval data.

However, unlike interval data, ratio scales do have a natural (non-arbitrarily chosen) zero point. 

So the concept of a ratio, and multiplying or dividing two values make perfect sense.

---

For example, imagine we have two apples:

One has a mass of 100 grams

And the other has a mass of 200 grams

Unlike an interval scale, it make perfect sense to say that a 100 gram apple is half the mass of a 200 gram apple.

This is because zero grams on this scale represents a natural minimum quantity (i.e. no mass at all).

So 200 grams of mass is twice as much mass as 100 grams of mass.

---

Other examples of ratio data include: 

the distance between two points, 

income from your job, 

and elapsed time.

The key distinction (once again) between interval and ratio scales is that the zero point on a ratio scale represents a natural zero quantity of the thing being measured.

It can be difficult to recognize the subtle yet important difference between interval scales and ratio scales, so if you're having difficulty understanding, you may want to research this topic further.

---

We can perform a few more mathematical operations on ratio data than we can on nominal, ordinal, and interval data.

In addition to all of the operations we've seen so far.

We can also multiply and divide ratio data.

In addition, we can determine the geometric mean, which is a method of averaging used for values with widely varying ranges.

Ratio data are the most powerful type of data we encounter in data science in terms of mathematical operations.","---

Welcome back to this introductory course on data for data science.

I'm Matthew Renze, data science consultant, author, and public speaker.

In this module, we'll learn about data types and how data are represented and stored in computer systems.

---

How do we represent data in a computer?

How does a computer know whether it's dealing with a word, a number, or a date and time?

And how does a computer know what types of operations can be performed on each type of data?

---

To answer these questions, we're going to learn about data types, and how we represent and store data in a computer.

First, we'll learn about data types, binary representations of data used by computer systems.

Next, we'll learn about scalar data types, representations of data that store a single value.

Then, we'll see about a few examples of common scalar data types you'll encounter in data science.

Next, we'll learn about composite data types, representations that store data as a group of related values.

Finally, we'll see about a few examples of common composite data types you'll encounter in data science.","---

title: 2 - Data Types

---

How do we represent data in a computer?

---

All data inside of modern computers are stored as a series of ones and zeros.

We call this binary data.

The ones and zeros are called binary digits (or ""bits"" for short).

In modern computers, data are stored in small blocks of eight bits called a ""byte"".

We can combine two, four, eight, or more bytes together to create larger blocks of binary data.

However, the computer needs to understand what each of these blocks of ones and zeros represent - is it a word, a number, a date and time, or something else?

This is where data types come into play... not to be confused with the ""types of data"" we discussed previously.

---

A data type is an attribute of data that tells the computer what a group of binary data represents.

They tell the computer how to interpret the bits of data - either as a character, a number, a date, or something else.

They determine what operations can be performed on the data like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

They specify how the data are stored and the size of the data by the number of bytes they require.

And they instruct the computer on how to display the data in a human-readable format.

---

For example:

We represent the letter A as a byte of binary digits using a sequence containing a zero, a one, five zeros, and a one.

We represent the digit one in binary as two zeros, two ones, three zeros, and a one.

And we represent the percent symbol as two zeros, a one, two more zeros, a one, a zero, and a one.

Essentially, we can represent anything that can be typed into a computer as a sequence of ones and zeros using data types.

---

In data science, there are two main divisions of data types:

First, we have scalar data types, also known as primitive data types, basic data types, or built-in data types.

Scalar data types represent the most basic building blocks of data by storing letters, numbers, and symbols in a computer as binary data.

Next, we have composite data types, also known as aggregate data types, compound data types, or more commonly, data structures.

Composite data types are composed of a set of scalar data types.

They organize the scalar data types and provide them with structure so that they can be worked with as a collection of values.

We're going to discuss both scalar data types, followed by composite data types, next.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 4 - Data Types
title: 3 - Scalar Data Types

---

The most basic building block of data in data science is a scalar data type.

---

Scalar data types store a single unit of data.

This can be a letter, a number, a date, a time, or something else.

We refer to them as scalar data types because a scalar variable in mathematics can hold one and only one value at a time.

Scalar data types are also the most basic unit of storage for data in a computer.

Everything from a small text document to a giant distributed database are composed of these single units of storage.

Scalar data types provide a set of operations that can be performed on the data they contain.

All of the processing that occurs in a computer is essentially the result of these operations being executed on scalar data types.

---

There are several scalar data types commonly used across various computers, programming languages, and data-science tools.

The most common data types you will encounter in data science can be divided into three main groups: 

categorical data types,

numerical data types.

and temporal data

Let's take a look at a few of the most common data types we encounter in data science.","---

title: 4 - Scalar Data Type Examples

---

In data science, we have several common scalar data types.

We're going to learn at the ones that you're most likely to encounter.

---

First, we have categorical data types.

We typically encounter three categorical data types in data science.

First, we have a character, which represents a single letter, digit, or symbol.

We can string together a sequence of characters (called a character string) to represent words, numbers, and bodies of text.

Character strings are very flexible for storing data, but they are not very efficient in terms of data processing and storage space.

Second, we have a Boolean, which represents either a true or a false value (and only a true or a false value).

Booleans allow us to efficiently store and process data composed of either yes or no answers.

Third, we have an Enumeration, which represents a set of named categories.

Enumerations allow us to efficiently store and process lists of named categories that contain a high degree of duplication.

---

Next, we have numerical data types.

We typically encounter three numerical data types in data science.

First, we have an integer, which represents a whole number.

Integers work well for storing and processing numbers that do not contain fractional values.

Second, we have a decimal, which represents a decimal fraction.

Decimals work well when we're dealing with fractional values (like money) that require perfectly accurate decimal arithmetic.

Third, we have a float, which represents numbers using a binary-equivalent of scientific notation.

Floats work well when we're dealing with very large or very small values but perfectly accurate measurements and arithmetic are not required.

---

Finally, we have temporal data types.

We typically encounter four temporal data types in data science.

First, we have a date, which represents time as a calendar day.

A Date data type works well when we just need to specify a year, a month, and a day but nothing more.

Second, we have a time data type, which represents a time of day.

A time data type is used when we just need to represent an hour, a minute, a second, and milliseconds but not a date.

Third, we have a date-time data type, which represents both a date and a time of day.

This data type is used when we need to represent time across days.

Fourth, we have a date-time with time-zone offset.

This data type is used when we need to represent dates and times across multiple time-zones around the world.

We could represent temporal data using numerical data types, however, it's often more efficient and convenient to use these specialized temporal data types instead.

There are several other scalar data types you may encounter in data science. 

However, the data types you've seen here are ones that you are most likely to encounter first.","---

title: 5 - Composite Data Type

---

Building upon scalar data types, we also have composite data types in data science.

---

A composite data type is a logical container used to organize related data.

It contains a set of scalar data types organized in a specific way.

Composite data types allow us to store and access information effectively.

They provide methods for accessing individual scalar values and performing operations on groups of scalar values.

In addition, composite data types provide context to related data which (as we discussed previously) is used to create information.

You can think of a composite data type as a container that holds a collection of related data in a specific way.

---

There are several types of composite data types that we encounter in data science. 

They can be grouped together in various ways. 

However, to keep things simple, we're going to organize them into the following four groups:

Homogenous data types - which require all data to be of the same data type

Tabular data types - which store data in a set of rows and columns

Semi-structured data types - which store data as a set of relationships

And multi-media data types - which store data for images, audio, video, and more.

Let's take a look at a few of the most common composite data types we encounter in data science.","---

First, we have a vector, also known as an array, which is a one-dimensional sequence of homogenous data.

Vectors are used to store a list of elements that are all of the same data type.

For example, character strings, which we discussed earlier, are a sequence of characters stored in a vector.

Second, we have a matrix, which is a two-dimensional grid of homogenous data.

Matrices are typically used to store and process groups of related numbers using a set of mathematical operations known as matrix algebra.

Finally, we have a tensor, which is a three-dimensional cube (or an n-dimensional hypercube) of homogenous data.

Tensors are typically used to create deep neural networks in machine learning, which is where the deep learning framework TensorFlow gets it's name.

---

Next, we have composite data types that represent tabular data.

First, we have a dictionary, which is a two-column table that stores a list of key-value pairs.

A dictionary, also known as a look-up table, is used to quickly retrieve data by a unique identifier.

Second, we have a table.

A table stores data as a set of rows and columns.

Tables are the most common way you will encounter structured data in data science.

We'll discuss tabular data in much more detail in the next module.

---

Next, we have composite data types that represent semi-structured data.

First, we have a tree, which organizes data as a set of nodes and branches.

Trees are used to represent hierarchical data (i.e. data that are organized into parent-child relationships).

Second, we have a graph, which organizes data as a set of nodes and edges.

Graphs are used to represent a network of data, representing each item as a node and each relationship as an edge.

---

Finally, we have composite data types to represent multimedia data.

For example: 

a body of text is essentially a long vector of characters.

Images are represented as a two-dimensional matrix of pixels.

Audio is represented as a one-dimensional vector of the amplitude of sound waves over time.

Video is represented as sound and a set of images moving frame-by-frame over time.

and shape data is a graph of points, lines, and polygons used construct geometric structures like maps and 3D objects.

Many more composite data types exist in data science; however, these are the ones that you are most likely to encounter.","---

Hello again.

I'm Matthew Renze, data science consultant, author, and public speaker.

Welcome back to this introductory course on data for data science.

In this module, we'll learn about tabular data and how we can extract information from tables of data using queries.

---

How do we extract information from data?

What's the best way to structure our data to extract information?

And how do we answer our questions once our data has been structured?

---

To answer these questions, we're going to learn about tabular data and how we extract information from tables using queries.

First, we'll learn about tabular data, data that are stored in the rows and columns of a table.

Next, we'll learn about observations, records of observable phenomena, which are stored in the rows.

Then, we'll learn about variables, values that vary for each observation, which are stored in the columns.

Next, we'll learn about relationships that can exist between observations in multiple tables.

Finally, we'll learn about queries, statements that allow a computer to answer a question using a table of data.","---

module: 5 - Tabular Data
title: 2 - Tabular Data

---

Tabular data are the most common form of structured data that we use for analysis in data science.

But what are tabular data and how do we organize our data in this way?

---

Tabular data are data organized into a table.

The table provides the data with structure.

A table, is a two-dimensional grid of data.

However, unlike a matrix, which we saw earlier, all of the elements in a table *do not* need to be all of the same data type 

Rather, all data *in each column* must be the same data type, which we refer to as homogenous data.

However, all data *in a row* can have different data types, from column to column, which we refer to as heterogenous data.

---

For example, imagine we have a table of patients at a hospital.

We would have a set of rows (one for each patient) and a set of columns, (one for each attribute of the patient).

Each element of data in a column must be the same data type.

For example, 

 - all of the names must be character strings,

 - all of the genders must be enumerations of male, female, or other genders,

 - all ages must be integers,

 - and so one.

However, the each row contains elements of various data types.

For example, 

 - the name ""Bill"" is a character string, 

 - the gender ""Male"" is an enumeration,

 - and the age ""21"" is an integer,

As we can see, each column contains only a single data type; however, each *row* can contain multiple data types.

---

In data science, tabular data can be broken down into three main components:

Observations - which we locate on the rows of a table

Variables - which we locate on the columns of a table

and Relationships - which connect data in one table to data in another table

We'll discuss each of these components, in more detail, next.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 5 - Tabular Data
title: 3 - Observations

---

Data science is founded upon making observations of the world around us.

But what are observations and how do we record them in tabular data?

---

An observation is a recording of the qualities and quantities of an observable phenomenon in the natural world.

This includes what we can see, hear, feel, or measure with sensors.

In data science, we record observations on the rows of a table.

The rows are the horizontal groups of data that are contained within the table.

---

For example, imagine that we are recording the vital signs of a patient at a hospital.

For each observation, we would record the date of the observation, the patient's heart rate, their temperature, and other vitals.

Each of these observations would be recorded on a separate row.

What is important to note is that all of the elements in a row of data belong to the same observation.

For example, a row of data can be an observation of a person, a place, a thing, or a set of sensor readings at a specific time.

In data science, we want each row to contain one and only one observation.

Essentially, each row should record one, and only one, person, place, or thing begin observed at a given time.

---

Outside of data science, the rows of a table of data go by various names.

First, you may hear them simply referred to as ""rows"", for, well, obvious reasons, I guess.

In computer science, they are often referred to as a tuples (or a tupples), which is a mathematical term for a list of data.

Or you may often hear them referred to simply as ""records"", because they store a recording of an observation, entity, or transaction of some kind.

No matter what they are called, observations should always be represented as rows in tabular data.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 5 - Tabular Data
title: 4 - Variables

---

The world is in a constant state of change; things vary from one observation to the next.

But how do we record these variations across observations in data science?

---

A variable is placeholder for a value that changes. 

We call them ""variables"" because their values ""vary"" across each observation.

In data science, we store variables on the columns of a table.

Columns are the vertical groups of data that are contained within the table.

---

For example, imagine we're recording vital signs for a patient at a hospital.

Our variables might be:

 - the date and time of the observation,

 - the patients heart rate measured by their pulse, 

 - and their body temperature at the time of the observation.

What is most important, is that all of the elements in a specific column must be of the same data type, scale, and unit of measure.

---

For example:

 - we don't want our dates to be stored using different date formats.

 - we don't want our heart rate data to be stored using two different data types.

 - and we don't want our temperature to use both Celsius and Fahrenheit units of measure.

---

Instead, we want all of the data in the column to use the same data type, same scale, and same units of measure.

Finally, we want one and only one variable per column of data.

We don't want to try placing multiple variables in a single column.

---

For example, if we're recording blood pressure, we record two numbers:

 - the systolic blood pressure,

 - and the diastolic blood pressure.

We don't want to record both of these measures in a single column, like we commonly see it written in our medical history.

---

Instead, we would prefer to have a single column for systolic blood pressure and a single column for diastolic blood pressure.

Storing each variable in a separate column allows us to store, process, and analyze the data more efficiently.

---

Outside of data science, the columns of a table go by various names.

First, you may simply hear them referred to as ""columns"".

In addition, you may also hear them referred to as ""attributes"".

Or in some cases, as ""properties"".

No matter what they are called, variables should always be represented as columns in tabular data.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 5 - Tabular Data
title: 5 - Relationships

---

Everything is related in some way, shape, or form.

So how do we represent relationships in data science?

---

In data science, we want each table to contain a single type of observation or type of entity.

For example, we want to keep a list of our patients in one table and a list of our doctors a separate table. 

We want each table to only contain data that are related to one another in a highly cohesive way.

We don't want to compress multiple types of observations or multiple types of entities into a single table.

So, we create a separate table for each type of observation or entity.

This means that our dataset often needs to be split up into multiple tables.

When we have multiple tables of data, the observations in one table can be related to the observations in another table.

---

A relationship is a way to express how a row of data in one table is related to a row of data in another table.

We create relationships between rows using ""keys"".

We use a primary key to uniquely identify an observation in it's source table.

Then we use a foreign key in observations in a second table to refer back to the original observation in the source table.

---

For example, imagine that we have two tables:

First, we have a table of patients.

It contains their names, genders, dates of birth, and more.

Second, we have a table of all of our patient's vital signs.

It contains observations of the patient's temperature, heart rate and more for a specific day.

We could duplicate the patient's name and other personal data for each recording of their vital signs.

However, it's much more efficient to store the patient's data once and then simply refer back to that data from the vital-signs table.

We do this by creating a primary key and a foreign key.

---

First, in our patients table, we create a column to store our primary key.

Then we create a primary key for each unique patient in our patients table.

We use a 1 for Bill, a 2 for Miko, and so on.

This primary key uniquely identifies each patient in our system.

---

Next, in our vital-signs table, we create a column for our foreign key 

We populate this column with the unique identifier that points back to the primary key.

We use a 1 for Bill, a 2 for Miko, and so on.

---

Now we can navigate the relationship forward from any patient to get their vital signs.

Or we can navigate the relationship backwards from a vital sign to get the patient's name and information.

Relationships allow us to connect data from table to table in many ways.

However, we'll have to defer these various types of relationships to a more advanced course on data science.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 5 - Tabular Data
title: 6 - Queries

---

How do we extract information from tabular data? 

The answer, is a query.

---

A query is computer representation of a question we want answer using a table of data.

They allow us to ask questions of the data and return answers as results.

Queries are created using programming languages.

More specifically, we use a special type of programming language called a query language.

The most popular query language is Structured Query Language (or SQL for short).

However, you can also perform queries using other programming languages like Python and R.

---

For example, let's say we want to answer the question: ""What was Bill's average body temperature over the past 5 years"".

We could write this question in the form of a SQL query.

The SQL query allows us to express that we want to:

 - select the average temperature

 - from the Vital Signs table

 - where the patient's name is ""Bill""

 - and the date is greater than or equal to January 1, 2015 (which we're assuming is five years ago).

I've intentionally kept this query simple for those of you who have never seen a SQL query before.

However, if you've had some experience with SQL, you may see several ways we could improve this query.

---

When we execute this query, 

First, the database will scan all of the records in the Vital Signs table 

Next, it will filter out anyone who is not our patient named Bill.

---

Then, it will filter out any row that is older than January 1, 2015.

---

Next, it will select just the Temperature column from the Vital Signs table.

---

Finally, it will compute the average of the remaining temperature values.

---

The computer will then return this value as a result.

As we can see, the result of executing this query is 37 degrees Celsius.

---

Essentially, this is how we get from a question to an answer, using a query.

We start with a question in our natural language,

 - we construct a SQL query to express that question to the computer, 

 - we execute the query which returns a result, 

 - and then we express that result in the form of an answer to the question.

Queries are the primary tool used for extracting information from data in data science.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 6 - Data Life Cycle
title: 2 - Collection

---

The first step in the data lifecycle is data collection.

---

We collect data about our world in a two-step process:

First, we observe a phenomenon that exists in the natural world.

This includes sensing the various qualities of the things we're observing and measuring their quantities as well.

Next, we record this observation using a symbolic representation.

In data science, this typically involves encoding the observation in a computer as a binary representation.

It's important to note that data do not exist until there has been both an observation and a recording of the observation.

Data are created as the result of something being observed and recorded as a signal or set of symbols.

Prior to a recording of an observation, there is no data, just the phenomenon that exists in the world.

---

There are several ways we can observe our world to collect data:

We can use sensors to record measurements of observable phenomena.

For example, we can record observations of the ambient air temperature using a digital thermometer.

We can enter data into a transactional system, to record business transactions.

For example, we can create records for new customers, record sales transactions, and create medical records.

We can also record human interactions with computer systems.

For example, we can record website visits, advertisement clicks, and time spent browsing a webpage.

And we can run experiments in order to generate new data in controlled environments.

For example, we can run clinical studies to determine the effectiveness of certain medications.

High quality data begins with data collection, so it's important to know how to properly observe and record data.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 6 - Data Life Cycle
title: 3 - Storage

---

The second step in the data lifecycle is data storage.

---

Once we've collected and recorded an observation as data, we need to store it so that it can be retrieved for future analysis.

As data are being recorded by sensors, these data are first recorded temporarily in a type of memory called volatile storage.

Volatile storage means that the data are lost when the device loses power.

As a result, we need to transfer our data somewhere more permanent, so that they will be available anytime we need them.

In data science, we store our data in one of several persistent-storage mediums.

Persistent storage, means that the device retains the data after the power to the device has been shut off.

For example, a computer's hard drive retains its data even if you turn the power off and then turn it back on again.

By storing our data in a persistent storage medium, we can retrieve our data as needed.

Unless we overwrite the data, or the device permanently fails, our data should always remain available.

---

Data can be stored in computers in several ways:

First, we have file-based formats - which store data in files on the filesystem of a computer.

For example, comma-separate values (or CSV) files and Excel spreadsheets.

Next, we have web-based formats - which store data in formats best suited for data transfer over the internet.

For example, eXtensible markup language (or XML) and javascript-object notation (or JSON)

Third, we have transactional databases - which store data in a form best suited for transaction processing.

For example, normalized relational databases and No-SQL databases.

Forth, we have analytical databases - which store data in a format best suited for analytical processing.

For example, data warehouses, data marts, and data cubes.

And finally, we have Big Data platforms - which can store massive data sets by distributing both data and processing across many computers

For example, Spark, Hive, and Hadoop.

There are many options to choose from, so it's important to know which option is right for your specific data-storage scenario.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 6 - Data Life Cycle
title: 4 - Processing

---

The third step in the data lifecycle is data processing.

---

Once we've stored our data, we need to process them in order to prepare them for analysis.

This involves several steps:

First, we may need to transform the data.

For example, we need to reshape tables, rename columns, convert data types, and encode or decode values.

Next, we may need to clean the data.

For example, we need to ensure internal data consistency, deal with missing values, and handle errors and anomalies.

Finally, may we need to query the data to extract just the subset of data we need for our analysis

For example, we need to select, filter, sort, group, and aggregate data from the persistent data store.

Essentially, we need to prepare our data so that our analysis will produce reliable results.

---

We can perform these data-processing tasks one of three ways:

First, we can perform these steps manually using tools like Microsoft Excel.

This option is only recommended for a quick, one-time, low-risk data analysis, that doesn't require any automation, auditing, or reproducibility.

Second, we can create scripts with programming languages like SQL, Python, or R.

Using scripts allows us to repeat the entire process automatically, iterate on the design over time, and document each step in the process.

Finally, we can create an automated data-processing pipeline, also known as a ""Data ETL"", which stands for Extract, Transform, and Load.

An automated pipeline provides a much more robust solution for data processing, but comes at a much higher cost to create and maintain.

Ultimately, we generally spend a lot of time and energy processing data in data science, so we want to choose the option that minimizes this effort in the long run.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 6 - Data Life Cycle
title: 5 - Analysis

---

The fourth step in the data lifecycle is data analysis.

---

Once we've processed our data, we want to analyze them to create new information that we can act upon.

There can be many reasons to perform a data analysis.

For example:

to provide support for or against decisions that we need to make,

to explain observations and behaviors that we see occurring,

and to discover new information from patterns that exist in the data.

---

There are numerous ways we can analyze data, for example:

We can create reports, which allow us to analyze both numerical and graphical information.

We can create dashboards, which present key-performance indicators (or KPIs) through a series of visual widgets.

We can perform interactive data analysis, using business intelligence tools (like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau).

We can perform data mining, which uses computer algorithms to find patterns of interest in large data sets.

We can perform machine learning, which involves humans training computer algorithms to detect patterns in new incoming data.

And we can automate data analysis with data-driven artificial intelligence, which involves machines teaching themselves how to solve problems on their own.

There are many ways that we can analyze data, so it's important that we choose the right tool for each type of data analysis we perform.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 6 - Data Life Cycle
title: 6 - Action

---

The next step in the data lifecycle is action.

---

Knowledge for the sake of knowledge is a noble pursuit and valuable in it's own right.

However, in order for data to be valuable to our business, it must lead to some form of action.

So, in data science we use the results of our data analysis to take an action of some kind.

This stage begins with making a decision on what action to take based on the data and our analysis.

This may also include making the decision *not* to act (i.e. choosing inaction based on our analysis).

Next, we take the appropriate action in order to affect positive change.

For example, we might approve a customer for a loan, recommend a product on our website, or change a business process.

Finally, this stage ends with an outcome which is either positive, negative, or resulted in no change at all.

We need to observe and record the outcome of our actions as data, because we're going to use this outcome in the final step in our process.

---

Action from data can take on many forms.

For example:

We can make a decision based upon our own data analysis and then act upon our decision.

We can communicate our findings to a wider audience in order to encourage others to take a specific action.

or we can automate a decision-making process with a computer so that the action happens automatically when the right pattern of data are observed by the machine.

No matter who is performing the action, we always want to make sure that we've chosen the best action given the data.","---

course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 6 - Data Life Cycle
title: 7 - Repeat

---

The final stage in the data lifecycle is to repeat the process.

---

As I mentioned in the previous step, it's important that we observe the outcome of our actions to see whether they made a positive impact, a negative impact, or led to no change at all.

We want to use this information as feedback to drive the next iteration of the process.

Feedback is very important in data science - it tells us whether we're steering the ship in the right direction or headed towards a giant cliff.

Data science is a highly iterative process, so we are typically repeating this feedback loop over and over on a regular basis.

The faster we can receive valuable feedback, the quicker we can make course corrections, and the sooner we can achieve our goals.

We want to use this feedback loop to drive continuous improvement in our business processes over time.

Essentially, this is how we optimize any business process -- by continuously improving it over time using feedback.

---

However, it's critically important to note that the success of this data-driven process is based on all of the steps that came before it.

So we need to ensure that:

we've collected reliable data from our observations, 

we've stored them correctly in the right type of persistent storage, 

we've processed them correctly using the right tools and methods, 

we've analyzed them correctly using the right tools and methods, 

we've made a rational decision based on results of our analysis,

and we've repeated this process using outcomes of our actions as feedback.

Performing all of these steps correctly is a bit more difficult than it sounds. 

This is why it's so important that you learn the rest of the details of data science -- so that you can always choose the best possible action given the data.","---

---

Welcome to the final module of this introductory course on data for data science.

I'm Matthew Renze, data science consultant, author and public speaker.

Now let's wrap things up for this course, so we can get started on our next course, and begin applying this knowledge in the real world.

---

You might be wondering:

Where should I go next?

What should I do to apply what I just learned?

And where should I go if I have questions or feedback?

---

First, I recommend that you practice to reinforce the information that you've learned.

So please complete all of the quiz questions,

and practice exercises for this course before you move on.

After years of research, and my own personal experience, we know that humans don't effectively learn new information unless they practice using it.

In fact, we forget about half of the information we've been taught within a hour of learning it and 75% within a few days.

However, if we practice, it reinforces the information and helps solidify it in our long-term memory.

This is the most effective way to maximize your learning and the value you derive from this course.

---

Next, if you're interested in learning more, I recommend taking the remaining courses in this series on data science.

This series contains all of the knowledge you will need to get started on your data-science journey.

There's plenty more to learn, so be sure to get started right away!

---

Finally, I encourage you to engage with me and others in this online learning community.

So please be sure to:

rate this course,

Ask questions in the discussion board,

Leave comments to let me know what you found valuable and what could be improved,

and feel free to send me a message on social media if you'd like to provide me with feedback in public.

Finally, let's summarize the key concepts that we learned in the course.

---

In this course, we learned about data as a foundation for data science.

First, we learned that data are a collection of facts that describe observations of the world around us.

Next, we learned that there are various types of data ... including categorical and numerical data.

Then, we learned that data can be represented and stored in computers using data types.

Next, we learned that tabular data are data organized into rows and columns so that they can be queried effectively.

Finally, we learned that data moves through a life cycle as a journey from data collection to action.

---

Thank you for joining me for this introductory course on data for data science.

I hope that you have found this information valuable and that it has helped you move forward on your data-science journey.

Please be sure to keep in touch via my website and social media... and I hope to see you again in another course in the near future.
