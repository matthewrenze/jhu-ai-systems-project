course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 3 - Types of Data
title: 7 - Summary

---

In this module, we learned about the various types of data that we encounter in data science.

---

First, we learned that data are divided conceptually into two main types: categorical data and numerical data.

Next, we learned about nominal data, named categories without an natural rank order.

Then, we learned about ordinal data, named categories with a natural rank order.

Next, we learned about interval data, numerical measurements with an arbitrary zero point.

Finally, we learned about ratio data, numerical measurements with a natural zero point.

In the next module, we'll learn about data types and how we store these various types of data in a computer.
