course: Intro to Data for Data Science
module: 4 - Data Types
title: 7 - Summary

---

In this module, we learned about data types and how we represent and store data in a computer.

---

First, we learned about data types, binary representations of data used by computer systems.

Next, we learned about scalar data types, representations of data that store a single value.

Then, we saw a few examples of common scalar data types you'll encounter in data science.

Next, we learned about composite data types, representations that store data as a group of related values.

Finally, we saw about a few examples of common composite data types you'll encounter in data science.
