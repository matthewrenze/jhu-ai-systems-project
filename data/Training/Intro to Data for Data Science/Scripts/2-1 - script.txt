Hello again. 

And welcome back to this introductory course on data for data science.

I'm Matthew Renze - data science consultant, author, and public speaker.

In this module, we'll learn about data.

We'll learn what it is, and why it's important for data science.

What is data?

... or technically, the more grammatically correct question is, ...

---

... "what *are* data?"

More importantly, what is the purpose of data?

And why is it important or useful to us in data science?

---

To answer these questions, we're going to learn about data and how it is used in data science.

First, we'll learn about data... what it is, and why it's important.

Next, we'll learn about information and how we can extract information from data.

Then, we'll learn about knowledge and how we can create knowledge from information.

Next, we'll learn about the purpose of data and how it leads to intelligent decision making.

Finally, we'll learn about the process of transforming raw data into actionable insight.
