title: 3 - Scalar Data Types

---

The most basic building block of data in data science is a scalar data type.

---

Scalar data types store a single unit of data.

This can be a letter, a number, a date, a time, or something else.

We refer to them as scalar data types because a scalar variable in mathematics can hold one and only one value at a time.

Scalar data types are also the most basic unit of storage for data in a computer.

Everything from a small text document to a giant distributed database are composed of these single units of storage.

Scalar data types provide a set of operations that can be performed on the data they contain.

All of the processing that occurs in a computer is essentially the result of these operations being executed on scalar data types.

There are several scalar data types commonly used across various computers, programming languages, and data-science tools.

The most common data types you will encounter in data science can be divided into three main groups: 

categorical data types,

numerical data types.

and temporal data

Let's take a look at a few of the most common data types we encounter in data science.
