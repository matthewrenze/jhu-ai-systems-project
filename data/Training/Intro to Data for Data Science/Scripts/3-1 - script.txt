Hello, and welcome back to this introductory course on data for data science.

I'm Matthew Renze, data science consultant, author, and public speaker.

In this module, we'll learn about the various types of data that we will encounter in data science.

What types of data exist in data science?

How do we conceptually divide data into groups based on what they represent?

And what are the limitations of each of these types of data?

---

To answer these questions, we're going to learn about the various types of data that exist in data science and their various capabilities and limitations.

First, we'll learn about the two most common types of data: categorical and numerical data.

Next, we'll learn about nominal data, named categories without a natural rank order.

Then we'll learn about ordinal data, named categories that do have a natural rank order.

Next, we'll learn about interval data, numerical measures with an arbitrary zero point.

Finally, we'll learn about ratio data, numerical measures with a natural zero point.
