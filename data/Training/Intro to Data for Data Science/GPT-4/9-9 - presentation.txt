# Tabular Data

| Name | Gender | Age |
| ---- | ------ | --- |
| Bill | Male   | 21  |
| Miko | Female | 15  |
| Juan | Other  | 45  |

<!--
For example, imagine we have a table of patients at a hospital.

We would have a set of rows (one for each patient) and a set of columns, (one for each attribute of the patient).

Each element of data in a column must be the same data type.

For example, 

 - all of the names must be character strings,

 - all of the genders must be enumerations of male, female, or other genders,

 - all ages must be integers,

 - and so one.

However, the each row contains elements of various data types.

For example, 

 - the name "Bill" is a character string, 

 - the gender "Male" is an enumeration,

 - and the age "21" is an integer,

As we can see, each column contains only a single data type; however, each *row* can contain multiple data types.

# Variables

Value that changes
On the columns
Same data type

| Date       | Pulse | Temp. |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- |
| 2023-01-01 | 89    | 39.0  |
| 2023-01-02 | 85    | 38.5  |
| 2023-01-03 | 80    | 37.2  | 


<!--
For example, imagine we're recording vital signs for a patient at a hospital.

Our variables might be:

 - the date and time of the observation,

 - the patients heart rate measured by their pulse, 

 - and their body temperature at the time of the observation.

What is most important, is that all of the elements in a specific column must be of the same data type, scale, and unit of measure.

# Variables

Value that changes
On the columns
Same data type

| Date         | Pulse      | Temp.     |
| ------------ | ---------- | --------- |
| **1/1/2023** | 89         | 39.0      |
| 2023-01-02   | **Normal** | 38.5      |
| 2023-01-03   | 80         | **99° F** | 


<!--
For example:

 - we don't want our dates to be stored using different date formats.

 - we don't want our heart rate data to be stored using two different data types.

 - and we don't want our temperature to use both Celsius and Fahrenheit units of measure.

# Relationships

## Patients
| Name | Gender | Age |
| ---- | ------ | --- |
| Bill | Male   | 21  |
| Miko | Female | 15  |
| Juan | Other  | 45  |


## Vital Signs
| Name | Date       | Temp. |
| ---- | ---------- | ----- |
| Bill | 2023-01-01 | 37.1  |
| Miko | 2023-01-01 | 38.1  |
| Miko | 2023-01-02 | 36.5  |


<!--
For example, imagine that we have two tables:

First, we have a table of patients.

It contains their names, genders, dates of birth, and more.

Second, we have a table of all of our patient's vital signs.

It contains observations of the patient's temperature, heart rate and more for a specific day.

We could duplicate the patient's name and other personal data for each recording of their vital signs.

However, it's much more efficient to store the patient's data once and then simply refer back to that data from the vital-signs table.

We do this by creating a primary key and a foreign key.

# Relationships

## Patients
| ID | Name | Gender | Age |
| -- | ---- | ------ | --- |
| 1  | Bill | Male   | 21  |
| 2  | Miko | Female | 15  |
| 3  | Juan | Other  | 45  |


## Vital Signs
| Patient ID | Date       | Temp. |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1          | 2023-01-01 | 37.1  |
| 2          | 2023-01-01 | 38.1  |
| 2          | 2023-01-02 | 36.5  |

<!--
Now we can navigate the relationship forward from any patient to get their vital signs.

Or we can navigate the relationship backwards from a vital sign to get the patient's name and information.

Relationships allow us to connect data from table to table in many ways.

However, we'll have to defer these various types of relationships to a more advanced course on data science.

# Queries

## Question

What was Bill's average 
body temperature 
over the past 5 years?

## SQL Query

select avg([Temperature])
from [Vital Signs]
where [Name] = "Bill"
and [Date] >= "2015-01-01"

<!--
For example, let's say we want to answer the question: "What was Bill's average body temperature over the past 5 years".

We could write this question in the form of a SQL query.

The SQL query allows us to express that we want to:

 - select the average temperature

 - from the Vital Signs table

 - where the patient's name is "Bill"

 - and the date is greater than or equal to January 1, 2015 (which we're assuming is five years ago).

I've intentionally kept this query simple for those of you who have never seen a SQL query before.

However, if you've had some experience with SQL, you may see several ways we could improve this query.

# Queries

## SQL Query

select avg([Temperature])
from [Vital Signs]
where [Patient Name] = "Bill"
and [Date] >= "2015-01-01"

## Vital Signs

| Date       | Name | Temp. |
| ---------- | ---- | ----- |
| 2010-01-01 | Bill | 37.0  |
| 2010-01-02 | Miko | 38.5  |
| 2010-01-03 | Juan | 38.2  | 


<!--
When we execute this query, 

First, the database will scan all of the records in the Vital Signs table 

Next, it will filter out anyone who is not our patient named Bill.

## Result

37.0

<!--
The computer will then return this value as a result.

As we can see, the result of executing this query is 37 degrees Celsius.

# Queries

## Question
What was Bill's average body temperature over the past 
5 years?

## Answer
It was 37°C.

<!--
Essentially, this is how we get from a question to an answer, using a query.

We start with a question in our natural language,

 - we construct a SQL query to express that question to the computer, 

 - we execute the query which returns a result, 

 - and then we express that result in the form of an answer to the question.

Queries are the primary tool used for extracting information from data in data science.
