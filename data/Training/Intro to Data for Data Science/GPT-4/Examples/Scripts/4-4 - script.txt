title: 4 - Scalar Data Type Examples

---

In data science, we have several common scalar data types.

We're going to learn at the ones that you're most likely to encounter.

---

First, we have categorical data types.

We typically encounter three categorical data types in data science.

First, we have a character, which represents a single letter, digit, or symbol.

Second, we have a Boolean, which represents either a true or a false value.

Third, we have an Enumeration, which represents a set of named categories.

---

Next, we have numerical data types.

We typically encounter three numerical data types in data science.

First, we have an integer, which represents a whole number.

Second, we have a decimal, which represents a decimal fraction.

Third, we have a float, which represents numbers using scientific notation.

---

Finally, we have temporal data types.

We typically encounter four temporal data types in data science.

First, we have a date, which represents time as a calendar day.

Second, we have a time data type, which represents a time of day.

Third, we have a date-time data type, which represents both a date and a time of day.

Fourth, we have a date-time with time-zone offset.
