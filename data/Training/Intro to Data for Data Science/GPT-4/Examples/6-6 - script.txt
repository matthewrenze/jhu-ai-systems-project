title: 6 - Action

---

The next step in the data lifecycle is action.

---

In data science we use the results of our data analysis to take an action of some kind.

This stage begins with making a decision on what action to take based on the data and our analysis.

Next, we take the appropriate action in order to affect positive change.

Finally, this stage ends with an outcome which is either positive, negative, or resulted in no change at all.

Action from data can take on many forms.

For example:

We can make a decision based upon our own data analysis.

We can communicate our findings to a wider audience.

or we can automate a decision-making process, so that the action happens automatically .
