For example, imagine we have a table of patients at a hospital.

We would have a set of rows (one for each patient) and a set of columns, (one for each attribute of the patient).

Each element of data in a column must be the same data type.

For example, 

 - all of the names must be character strings,

 - all of the genders must be enumerations of male, female, or other genders,

 - all ages must be integers,

 - and so one.

However, the each row contains elements of various data types.

For example, 

 - the name "Bill" is a character string, 

 - the gender "Male" is an enumeration,

 - and the age "21" is an integer,

---

For example:

 - we don't want our dates to be stored using different date formats.

 - we don't want our heart rate data to be stored using two different data types.

 - and we don't want our temperature to use both Celsius and Fahrenheit units of measure.

---

For example, imagine that we have two tables:

First, we have a table of patients.

It contains their names, genders, dates of birth, and more.

Second, we have a table of all of our patient's vital signs.

It contains observations of the patient's temperature, heart rate and more for a specific day.

---

When we execute this query, 

First, the database will scan all of the records in the Vital Signs table 

Next, it will filter out anyone who is not our patient named Bill.

---

The computer will then return this value as a result.

As we can see, the result of executing this query is 37 degrees Celsius.
