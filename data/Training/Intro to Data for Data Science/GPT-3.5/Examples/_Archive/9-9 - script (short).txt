For example, imagine we're recording vital signs for a patient at a hospital.

Our variables might be:

 - the date and time of the observation,

 - the patients heart rate measured by their pulse, 

 - and their body temperature at the time of the observation.

What is most important, is that all of the elements in a specific column must be of the same data type, scale, and unit of measure.

---

For example:

 - we don't want our dates to be stored using different date formats.

 - we don't want our heart rate data to be stored using two different data types.

 - and we don't want our temperature to use both Celsius and Fahrenheit units of measure.

---

For example, imagine that we have two tables:

First, we have a table of patients.

It contains their names, genders, dates of birth, and more.

Second, we have a table of all of our patient's vital signs.

It contains observations of the patient's temperature, heart rate and more for a specific day.

We could duplicate the patient's name and other personal data for each recording of their vital signs.

However, it's much more efficient to store the patient's data once and then simply refer back to that data from the vital-signs table.

We do this by creating a primary key and a foreign key.

---

Now we can navigate the relationship forward from any patient to get their vital signs.

Or we can navigate the relationship backwards from a vital sign to get the patient's name and information.

Relationships allow us to connect data from table to table in many ways.

However, we'll have to defer these various types of relationships to a more advanced course on data science.

When we execute this query, 

First, the database will scan all of the records in the Vital Signs table 

Next, it will filter out anyone who is not our patient named Bill.

---

Finally, it will compute the average of the remaining temperature values.

---

The computer will then return this value as a result.

As we can see, the result of executing this query is 37 degrees Celsius.
