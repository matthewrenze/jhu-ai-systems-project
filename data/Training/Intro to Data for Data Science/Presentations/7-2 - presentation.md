<!--
In this course, we learned about data as a foundation for data science.

First, we learned that data are a collection of facts that describe observations of the world around us.

Next, we learned that there are various types of data ... including categorical and numerical data.

Then, we learned that data can be represented and stored in computers using data types.

Next, we learned that tabular data are data organized into rows and columns so that they can be queried effectively.

Finally, we learned that data moves through a life cycle as a journey from data collection to action.
