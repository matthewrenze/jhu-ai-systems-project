# Conclusion

<!--
Welcome to the final module of this introductory course on data for data science.

I'm Matthew Renze, data science consultant, author and public speaker.

Now let's wrap things up for this course, so we can get started on our next course, and begin applying this knowledge in the real world.

# Where should I go next?

<!--
You might be wondering:

Where should I go next?

What should I do to apply what I just learned?

And where should I go if I have questions or feedback?

# Practice

Quizzes
Exercises

<!--
First, I recommend that you practice to reinforce the information that you've learned.

So please complete all of the quiz questions,

and practice exercises for this course before you move on.

After years of research, and my own personal experience, we know that humans don't effectively learn new information unless they practice using it.

In fact, we forget about half of the information we've been taught within a hour of learning it and 75% within a few days.

However, if we practice, it reinforces the information and helps solidify it in our long-term memory.

This is the most effective way to maximize your learning and the value you derive from this course.
