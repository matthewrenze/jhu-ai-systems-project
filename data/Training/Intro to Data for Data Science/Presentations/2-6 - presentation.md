<!--
Let's take a look at a simple example of intelligent data-driven decision making in action.

<!--
Imagine that we're an investor.

We're considering making an investment in apples -- the edible kind -- not the iPod kind.

Our goal, obviously, is to make a profit.

However, we want to make our investment using a data-driven decision-making process.

# Process

Data - price of apples
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

![image An icon of an apple with the text $2 per kg under the apple](images/placeholder.png)

<!--
First, we learn that the price of apples has been holding steady for the past year at $2 per kilogram (which is about $2 for 6 apples).

We create data when we observe and record the current price of apples at $2 per kilogram.
-->

# Process

Data - price of apples
Information - price increase
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

![image An icon of an apple with the text $3 per kg under the apple](images/placeholder.png)

<!--
Next we learn that the price of apples has risen this month from $2 per kilogram to $3 per kilogram.

This price increase was caused by a rapid, unexpected increase in consumer demand.

We create information when we analyze the historical price data and discover the $1 increase in the price of apples this month.

# Process

Data - price of apples
Information - price increase
Knowledge - price relationship
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

![image An icon of an apple with the text "↑ $1 per kg", an icon of a jug with the text "↑ $1.50 per L" and an arrow pointing from the apple to the jug](images/placeholder.png)

<!--
Then, from many years of observation, we've learned that when the price of apples goes up by $1 per kilogram, then price of apple cider will likely rise by $1.50 per liter in the following month.

We acquired knowledge when we learned about the relationship between an increase in the price of apples and an increase in the price of apple cider.

# Process

Data - price of apples
Information - price increase
Knowledge - price relationship
Decision - decide to invest
<br/>
<br/>

![image An icon of a jug with a check mark on top of it](images/placeholder.png)

<!--
Next, based on our existing knowledge and the new information about the price increase, we make a decision.

We decide it would be smart to invest in apple cider now, before the price of apple cider rises by an extra $1.50 per liter next month.

# Process

Data - price of apples
Information - price increase
Knowledge - price relationship
Decision - decide to invest
Action - invest in apple cider
<br/>

![image An icon of a hand holding a bag of money with a dollar sign ($) on the side of the bag](images/placeholder.png)

<!--
Then, based on our decision, we take action.

We invest in apple cider on the commodities market at it's current (discounted) price, in anticipation of an increase in price, and thus an increase in the value of our investment.

# Process

Data - price of apples
Information - price increase
Knowledge - price relationship
Decision - decide to invest
Action - invest in apple cider
Goal - profit!

![image An icon of a dollar sign ($) inside of a circle](images/placeholder.png)

<!--
Finally, if everything worked out in our favor, and the price of apple cider rises as predicted, we will have achieved our goal of capturing a profit on our investment.

However, achieving our goal is entirely dependent upon having correct data, information, knowledge, decisions, actions -- and the apple-cider market working in our favor! : )

While this has been an overly simplified example of how data-driven decision making works, hopefully it helped to demonstrate to you how we use data to achieve a goal with data science.
