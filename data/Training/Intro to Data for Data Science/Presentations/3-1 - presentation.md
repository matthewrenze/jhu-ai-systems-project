What types of data exist in data science?

<!--
To answer these questions, we're going to learn about the various types of data that exist in data science and their various capabilities and limitations.

First, we'll learn about the two most common types of data: categorical and numerical data.

Next, we'll learn about nominal data, named categories without a natural rank order.

Then we'll learn about ordinal data, named categories that do have a natural rank order.

Next, we'll learn about interval data, numerical measures with an arbitrary zero point.

Finally, we'll learn about ratio data, numerical measures with a natural zero point.
