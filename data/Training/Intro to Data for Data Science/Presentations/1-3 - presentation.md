# Purpose

To learn about data as a foundation 
for data science

<!--
The purpose of this course is to learn about data as a foundation for data science.

It might seem obvious, but half of data science is data, so as you can imagine, it's really important to have a thorough understanding of data to be successful with data science. 

This course was designed to provide you with that foundational knowledge.

<!--
As an overview of this course:

First, we'll learn about data. 

We'll learn what it is, and why it's important for data science.

Next we'll learn about the various types of data we encounter in data science, including categorical and numerical data.

Then we'll learn about data types, and how we represent and store various kinds of data in a computer.

Next, we'll learn about data structures, and how providing structure to data gives it additional context and meaning.

Then, we'll learn about tabular data, tables of data organized into rows and columns that allow us to perform queries.

Finally, we'll learn about the data life cycle.

We'll learn about the journey of data as we move from raw data to actionable insight.
