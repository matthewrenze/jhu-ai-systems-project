To answer these questions, we're going to follow the journey of data from data collection to action.

First, we'll learn about data collection and how we record observations of our world.

Next, we'll learn about data storage, and the various types of data repositories we encounter.

Then, we'll learn about data processing, and steps we perform to prepare our data for analysis.

Next, we'll learn about data analysis, and the many tools we can use to analyze data.

Then, we'll learn about taking action based on the results of our analysis.

Finally, we'll learn about how we repeat this process, using feedback as our guide, to optimize over time.
