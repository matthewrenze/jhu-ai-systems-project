<!--
First, we learned that data are raw and unorganized facts created from recording observations of the world around us.

Next, we learned that information is data that has been organized, analyzed, and interpreted to provide it with additional context and meaning.

Then, we learned that knowledge is a collection of information that can be used to solve problems in a specific domain.

Next, we learned that the purpose of data is to make intelligent, rational decisions that lead to actions that achieve a goal of some kind.

Finally, we learned that the data-driven decision-making process involves transforming data, into information, into knowledge, to a decision, and finally, to an action that achieves a goal.

In the next module, we're learn about data types and how data are stored in computer systems.
