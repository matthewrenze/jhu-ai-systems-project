In this course, we learned about data as a foundation for data science.

[1] First, we learned that data are a collection of facts that describe observations of the world around us.

[2] Next, we learned that there are various types of data ... including categorical and numerical data.

[3] Then, we learned that data can be represented and stored in computers using data types.

[4] Next, we learned that tabular data are data organized into rows and columns so that they can be queried effectively.

[5] Finally, we learned that data moves through a life cycle as a journey from data collection to action.
