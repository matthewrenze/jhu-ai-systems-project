<!--
Let's take a look at a simple example of intelligent data-driven decision making in action.

<!--
Imagine that we're an investor.

[1] We're considering making an investment in apples.

... the edible kind... not the iPod kind.

[2-3] Our goal, obviously, is to make a profit.

However, we want to make our investment using a data-driven decision-making process.

# Process

Data - price of apples

$2 per kg

![image](images/497-4.png)

<!--
[1] First, we learn that the price of apples has been holding steady for the past year at $2 per kilogram (which is about $2 for 6 apples).

[2] We create data when we observe and record the current price of apples at $2 per kilogram.

# Process

Data - price of apples
Information - price increase

$3 per kg

<!--
[1] Next we learn that the price of apples has risen this month from $2 per kilogram to $3 per kilogram.

This price increase was caused by a rapid, unexpected increase in consumer demand.

[2] We create information when we analyze the historical price data and discover the $1 increase in the price of apples this month.

Data - price of apples
Information - price increase
Knowledge - price relationship

$1 per kg

$1.50 per L

<!--
[1-3] Then, from many years of observation, we've learned that when the price of apples goes up by $1 per kilogram, then price of apple cider will likely rise by $1.50 per liter in the following month.

[4] We acquired knowledge when we learned about the relationship between an increase in the price of apples and an increase in the price of apple cider.

# Process

Data - price of apples
Information - price increase
Knowledge - price relationship
Decision - decide to invest

<!--
[1] Next, based on our existing knowledge and the new information about the price increase, we make a decision.

[2] We decide it would be smart to invest in apple cider now, before the price of apple cider rises by an extra $1.50 per liter next month.

# Process

Data - price of apples
Information - price increase
Knowledge - price relationship
Decision - decide to invest
Action - invest in apple cider

![image](images/524-7.png)

<!--
Then, based on our decision, we take action.

[1] We invest in apple cider on the commodities market at it's current (discounted) price... in anticipation of an increase in price... and thus an increase in the value of our investment.

# Process

Data - price of apples
Information - price increase
Knowledge - price relationship
Decision - decide to invest
Action - invest in apple cider
Goal - profit!

![image](images/525-4.png)

<!--
[1] Finally, if everything worked out in our favor, and the price of apple cider rises as predicted, we will have achieved our goal of capturing a profit on our investment.

However, achieving our goal is entirely dependent upon having correct data, information, knowledge, decisions, actions...

... and the apple-cider market working in our favor! : )

While this has been an overly simplified example of how data-driven decision making works, hopefully it helped to demonstrate to you how we use data to achieve a goal with data science.
