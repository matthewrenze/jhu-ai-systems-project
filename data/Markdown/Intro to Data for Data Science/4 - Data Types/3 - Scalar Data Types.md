# Scalar Data Types

Single unit of data
Stores one value
Unit of storage
Set of operations


<!--
[1] Scalar data types store a single unit of data.

This can be a letter, a number, a date, a time, or something else.

[2] We refer to them as scalar data types because a scalar variable in mathematics can hold one and only one value at a time.

[3] Scalar data types are also the most basic unit of storage for data in a computer.

Everything from a small text document to a giant distributed database are composed of these single units of storage.

[2] Scalar data types provide a set of operations that can be performed on the data they contain.

All of the processing that occurs in a computer is essentially the result of these operations being executed on scalar data types.

<!--
There are several scalar data types commonly used across various computers, programming languages, and data-science tools.

The most common data types you will encounter in data science can be divided into three main groups: 

[1] categorical data types,

[2] numerical data types.

[3] and temporal data

Let's take a look at a few of the most common data types we encounter in data science.
