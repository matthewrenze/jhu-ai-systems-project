# Spatial Data Types

Latitude

Longitude



<!--
Next, we have spatial data types.

[1-2] Spatial data are commonly represented using latitude and longitude.

These two coordinates are often expressed in terms of degrees, minutes, and seconds to the North or South of the equator and to the East, or West of the prime meridian.

In addition, it's becoming more common to represent them in decimal degrees using positive and negative numbers to represent directions.

While these two coordinates can be stored using numeric data types, it's often more convenient to store them using specialized spatial data types.

# Other Data Types

Rational

Complex



<!--
There are also other less frequently used data types that exist in data science.

These other data types are used to represent:

 [1] - exact fractions (called rational numbers), 

 [2] - complex numbers (i.e. a number with a real and an imaginary component), 

 - and more

However, we'll leave these more specialized data types for a more advanced course on data science.

# Limited-access Data Types

Stack

Queue



<!--
Next, we have the limited-access data structures.

[1] First, we have a stack, which stores and accesses data in a last-in, first out format.

Stacks only allow us to push a new item on the stack and pop the top-most item back off.

[2] Second, we have a queue, which stores data in a first-in, first-out format.

A queue only allows us to add a new item to the back of the queue and remove a new item from the front of the queue.
