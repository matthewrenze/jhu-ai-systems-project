<!--
To answer these questions, we're going to learn about the various types of data that exist in data science and their various capabilities and limitations.

[1] First, we'll learn about the two most common types of data: categorical and numerical data.

[2] Next, we'll learn about nominal data, named categories without a natural rank order.

[3] Then we'll learn about ordinal data, named categories that do have a natural rank order.

[3] Next, we'll learn about interval data, numerical measures with an arbitrary zero point.

[4] Finally, we'll learn about ratio data, numerical measures with a natural zero point.
