<!--
[1] First, we learned that data are divided conceptually into two main types: categorical data and numerical data.

[2] Next, we learned about nominal data, named categories without an natural rank order.

[3] Then, we learned about ordinal data, named categories with a natural rank order.

[4] Next, we learned about interval data, numerical measurements with an arbitrary zero point.

[5] Finally, we learned about ratio data, numerical measurements with a natural zero point.

In the next module, we'll learn about data types and how we store these various types of data in a computer.
