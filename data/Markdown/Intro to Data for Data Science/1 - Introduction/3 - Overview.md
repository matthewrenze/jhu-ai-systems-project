# Purpose

To learn about data as a foundation 
for data science

<!--
[1] The purpose of this course is to learn about data as a foundation for data science.

It might seem obvious, but half of data science is data, ...

... so as you can imagine, it's really important to have a thorough understanding of data to be successful with data science. 

This course was designed to provide you with that foundational knowledge.

<!--
As an overview of this course:

[1] First, we'll learn about data. 

We'll learn what it is... and why it's important for data science.

[2] Next we'll learn about the various types of data we encounter in data science ...

... including categorical and numerical data.

[3] Then we'll learn about data types ...

... and how we represent and store various kinds of data in a computer.

[4] Next, we'll learn about data structures ...

... and how providing structure to data gives it additional context and meaning.

[5] Then, we'll learn about tabular data ...

... tables of data organized into rows and columns that allow us to perform queries.

[6] Finally, we'll learn about the data life cycle.

We'll learn about the journey of data as we move from raw data to actionable insight.
