However, the 1890 US census, took only 18 months thanks to Herman Hollerith's punch-card-based "Tabulating Machine".

<!--
By the mid-1900s, digital computers allowed us to store and analyze data as bits of information encoded as ones and zeros.

<!--
In the 2000s, big-data platforms emerged to handle very large data sets by spreading data and processing across several computers in a cluster.

<!--
In the next decade and beyond, the field of data science will continue to grow and will likely evolve into data-driven artificial intelligence.

A new era of data that will almost certainly change our world in more ways than we could possibly imagine.
