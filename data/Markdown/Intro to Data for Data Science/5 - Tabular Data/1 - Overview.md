Welcome back to this introductory course on data for data science.

In this module, we'll learn about tabular data ...

... and how we can extract information from tables of data using queries.

<!--
To answer these questions, we're going to learn about tabular data and how we extract information from tables using queries.

[1] First, we'll learn about tabular data, data that are stored in the rows and columns of a table.

[2] Next, we'll learn about observations, records of observable phenomena, which are stored in the rows.

[3] Then, we'll learn about variables, values that vary for each observation, which are stored in the columns.

[4] Next, we'll learn about relationships that can exist between observations in multiple tables.

[5] Finally, we'll learn about queries, statements that allow a computer to answer a question using a table of data.
