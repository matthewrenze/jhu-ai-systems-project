<!--
[1] First, we learned about data types, binary representations of data used by computer systems.

[2] Next, we learned about scalar data types, representations of data that store a single value.

[3] Then, we saw a few examples of common scalar data types you'll encounter in data science.

[4] Next, we learned about composite data types, representations that store data as a group of related values.

[5] Finally, we saw about a few examples of common composite data types you'll encounter in data science.
