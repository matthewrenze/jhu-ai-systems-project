<!--
[1] First, we learned that tabular data are data that are organized into tables consisting of rows and columns.

[2] Next, we learned that observations are records of observable phenomena, which are stored on the rows.

[3] Then, we learned that variables contain values that vary across each observation, which are stored on the columns.

[4] Next, we learned that we can create relationships between observations in two or more tables by using primary and foreign keys.

[5] Finally, we learned that queries allow us to ask questions of tabular data and return answers in the form of information.

In the next module, we'll learn about the data life cycle -- the journey of data as it is transformed from raw data to actionable insight.
